Which was the main goal that I worked on, but I was surprised after a couple of months of the results that Hadith Tech had achieved which was:</p><ul><li>Top 10 in the technology Category in Apple Podcast in the MENA region!</li><li>Reached directly to more than 1700 unique viewers</li><li>More than 300 hours of watch/listen</li></ul><p>Those results show such an awesome impact of humble work.</p><p>Because of all of that I wanted to genuinely appreciate and thank those who took place in the show and helped it to reach this awesome results, it‚Äôs hard to do this since people would think it‚Äôs a one man work or even success because of hard working, yet we forget the most important part: The speakers and the team! In this blog, I will try humbly to thank everyone who was a reason for the show to succeed.</p><p><strong>My Mother:</strong>
Usually mothers would be the one who are in the background, supporting their children and helping them with their lives. They do a lot of great work that we could never appreciate or pay back for, however we should try to thank them! Since, mothers are those who grow, teach and stay awake at night for their children, so here I am just humbly saying thank you mother for every single second you spent with us and your whole encouragement for this show.</p><p><strong>My Family:</strong>
